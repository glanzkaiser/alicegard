# About 
Presentation slides that I downloaded as source of learning from 2019 ATPESC.

For two weeks on summer 2019, a group of 73 students and early career researchers took up residence at Q Center in St. Charles, IL for an arduous training program designed to teach them the key skills and tools needed to efficiently use leading-edge supercomputers.

The Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC) is an intense, two-week program that focuses on the key skills, approaches, and tools needed to conduct computational science and engineering research on today’s and tomorrow’s high-end supercomputers.

At the August 2019 ATPESC, we captured 67 hours of lectures in 71 videos of presentations by pioneers and experts in the HPC community on topics ranging from programming techniques and numerical algorithms to trends in HPC architectures and software.
