# About Alicegard
Include guidebooks and free Books for expanding knowledge that can be used by anyone.

One day there will be a flying university that can teleport as well called AliceGard, inspired by Balamb Garden as Final Fantasy VIII is the first Final Fantasy that Glanz played. She thinks Rinoa is very beautiful because she hasn't meet me yet.

We believe that there are always someone better, smarter, and stronger than we are. Those who think highly of themselves will go down.
While those who are more and more humble will rise up till the highest and even more. Learn from history that who loses are those who always think they are better than others. Enigma can be solved. Nothing is impossible.

# Zerolif (Coming Soon)
After learning till PhDs finished one day and have our own Arqlab, perhaps have finished my F18G for Freya and Freya Capella (a wonder for a beautiful wife, just imagine a Sistine Chapel for the interior and Hanging Garden outside, full of beautiful arts of love) we will use our knowledge in science and engineering to solve the world's problems. Compile it into Zerolif. It will be published in the future. Wait for it.
