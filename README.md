# About Alicegard
Include guidebooks and free Books for expanding knowledge that can be used by anyone.

One day there will be a flying university that can teleport as well called AliceGard, inspired by Balamb Garden as Final Fantasy VIII is the first Final Fantasy that Glanz played. She thinks Rinoa is very beautiful because she hasn't meet me yet.

We believe that there are always someone better, smarter, and stronger than we are. Those who think highly of themselves will go down.
While those who are more and more humble will rise up till the highest and even more. Learn from history that who loses are those who always think they are better than others. Enigma can be solved. Nothing is impossible.
